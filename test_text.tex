where $\Gamma$ is the line width of the atomic transition. For the effectively two-level cooling transition used for Doppler cooling $^{87}$Rb\footnote{The D$_2$ line, $5\up{S}_{1/2}\rightarrow$ $5\up{P}_{3/2}$, approximately 780 nm.}, this gives $146\,\upmu$K, which is approximately a factor of a thousand too high for Bose-condensation. These atoms are also not trapped.
